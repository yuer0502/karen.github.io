Today we run the **kallisto** on the whole data (12GB in total) and finish the script for volcano image in DEGs analysis by **DEseq2**.

## What we have done today:
### Run the whole data with **kallisto**.

- The *index* has been created with reference *PCC6803* before.
 
- Running the *quant* step on the whole data took some time.

### Solve the problem in plot of DEseq2 before.

- Using the **volcano** insteads the **PlotA** to draw the image for DEGs with selected standard (|log2(FC)|>2 and *P* < 0.05).

- Wrote the script of **volcano** with **R** and obtained four images.
 
## Problems we met:
1. I think the differential genes are limited by the selected standard (|log2(FC)|>2 and *P* < 0.05) to some extend, showing only around 10 genes for each experiment group. Because this low number of genes might lead the limitation for investigating the KEGG pathways in the next step. Group members thought that was OK so we will see later.

2. The further study of DEGs have not decided.  

3. The tool for analysing the **GO** has not been found as the tool for *Synechocystis* is few. 

## Plan:
- We will discuss the studies and tools for DEGs on Friday 14th Dec.

- Maybe we should ask or discuss the future analysis with tutor, after all, we have almost finish the basic target.

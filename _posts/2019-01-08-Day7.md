Today I further the assessment for the dataset from **kallisto**.

## What we have done today:
### Looking for some workflow for RNA analysis and checked how they assessed the quality of dataset.

- Wrote codes for matrix counts assessment and samle-to-sample distance to check the dataset quality after kallisto analysis.
	- Both the qualities looked nice even we have not remove the adapters, clean the data before.
	- Uploaded the results to drive. 
 


 
 
## Problems we met:
1. There are various workflow to do assessment, I followed one instruction as the result. But I have tried others method as well, the result was similar to the previous one.



## Plan:
- We plan to do the poster online tomorrow.

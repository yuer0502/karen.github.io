Discuss the protocol of RNA-seq for the DE analysis in scilife.
# Main point:
## Know the background of data (only platform, size and type, do not know the source, maybe this is secret).
  - Platform NextSeq 500 System, NextSeq 500/550 High Output v2 kit (75-bp read length, single end, dual index)
  - Type: 	 FASTQ
  - Size: 	 15GB [(4 samples + 1 control) *3]
## Decide the protocol for the analysis.
# There are two ways for the analysis in order to discuss in seminar tomorrow before making final decision.
### Common steps: 
  1. Adapter removal(cutadapt) 
  2. Quality Control(FASTQC/HTQC) 
  3. Quality filter(sickle)
### Branches:
#### first version:
  5. ncDNA removal(bowtie) 
  6. genome alignment(bowtie)
  7. normalisation
  8. DeEseq2
#### second version:
  5. kallisto
  6. DEseq2
### Create this diary for recording future work!
### Main problems for the future.
  - The script writing for the pepline.
  - Allocation in the group.
  - Schedule plan for the project.

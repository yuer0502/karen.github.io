Today we discussed the Deseq2 to some extent and made the slides for seminar tomorrow.

## What we have done today:
### Discuss quality for the Deseq2 analysis.
Feride wrote the script to do Deseq2 analysis and showed the results.

- The quality of data is Ok but might be improved with some changes we will see later.
 
## Problems we met:
1. Wether the quality is influenced by the previous dispose is not sure.
2. Some problems in Deseq2 analysis should be discussed.  

## Plan:
- Meeting and discuss these problems after seminar tomorrow.
- Just in case, prepare the files with dispose such as adapter reduce, filtering etc.

By the way, I should think how to contribute more for the project.

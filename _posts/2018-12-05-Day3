Today I installed the packages seqmagick,kallisto and cutadapt on the computer and tried to cut adapters of reversed sequences.

## What I have done today:
### Successfully installed the packages and reverse the sequences:
eg.
'''
seqmagick convert NT0-1_red_rev.fastq.gz NT0-1_red_rev.fasta.gz
'''
### Cut adapters:
The information for the adapter:
> NEBNext libraries: cutadapt -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCT  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM2864620)
eg.
'''
cutadapt -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCT -o NT0-1_red_cut.fastq.gz NT0-1_red_rev.fastq.gz
'''
### Use kallisto:
1. index
eg.
'''
kallisto index -i NT0-1_red.idx NT0-1_red.fasta.gz 
'''
2. quant
eg.
'''
kallisto quant -i NT0-1_red.idx -o output -b 100 --single -l 75 -s 1 ref.fa.gz
'''
## Problems:
- We know that Kallisto might skip the adapters because of the small length (<31 bps), which is the defult length of k-mers. Hence, the work here can be seen as confirmation for this problem.  
- I have not finished the whole steps in Kallisto and prepare to discuss with partners tomorrow.
- Stucked in the installation problem for a while.

## Solution:
- Need more experience in the packages installation such as setting the pathway.

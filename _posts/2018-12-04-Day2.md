# What we have done today:
## Try Kallisto on the dropbox file
### Log in the Uppmax remote to use kallisto.
- use ssh to log in the remote and create the directory
- module add the kallisto after bioinformatic-tools
- run the kallisto directly 
    1. index
    2. quant
# Problem we met:
- We do not know the string lengh and standard deviation (required in single-pair end sequencing) during the library construction.
- We are not sure if the 'Adapter removel' is needed before running the Kallisto.

# Solution:
- Write email to ask for the detailed information.
- Search literature to see if we need to remove the adapter.

# Result:
- Maybe calculate the SD value tomorrow, the average read lengnth we can use is 75/76.
- Decide to compare two ways before Kallisto.

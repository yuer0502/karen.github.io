Today we will finish our work before presentation.

## What we have done today:
### Finish the poster online together.

- I was responsible mainly for the result in Dataset assessment and workflow of our work by illustrator.
	- As the assessment result looked similar, we choosed the example ssl2982 to show the quality.
	- For the workflow, learned how to use illustrator and made that based on previous work. 
- Discussed with partners how to make the poster better and formated some part of the poster with my partners later.  
 


 
## Problems we met:
1. Recheck the data because the markers for the data are not true. Feride rerun the result and me too.
2. Choosed the final pictures we want to use in the poster as the limitaed space cannot satisfy all results.
3. Formating problem took much time to edit.



## Plan:
- Plan to send today!
